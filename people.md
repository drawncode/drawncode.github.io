> I'm currently pursuing BTech in Electrical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Mandi. Robotics, IoT and Artificial Intelligence are some of my interests. The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.It would take off on its own, and re-design itself at an ever increasing rate. Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn't compete, and would be superseded.
